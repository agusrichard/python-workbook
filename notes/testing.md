### Testing Your Code
- Exploratory testing is a form of testing that is done without a plan. In an exploratory test, you’re just exploring the application.
- Automated testing is the execution of your test plan (the parts of your application you want to test, the order in which you want to test them, and the expected responses) by a script instead of a human.
- Testing multiple components is known as integration testing.
- A major challenge with integration testing is when an integration test doesn’t give the right result. It’s very hard to diagnose the issue without being able to isolate which part of the system is failing.
- A unit test is a smaller test, one that checks that a single component operates in the right way.
- An integration test checks that components in your application operate with each other.
- A unit test checks a small component in your application.
