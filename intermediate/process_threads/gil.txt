Global interpreter lock (GIL)
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python

- Needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe

- Avoid:
    - Use multiprocessing
    - Use a different, free-threaded Python implementation (Jython, IronPython)
    - Use python as a wrapper for third party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
